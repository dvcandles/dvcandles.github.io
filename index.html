              Dart Valley Candles is based near the River Dart in beautiful Devon.  Our candles are hand poured by two friends passionate that their products contain high quality ingredients. We blend the essential oils to make our own unique scents and source the best soy/plant wax to work in synergy with the oils.  No synthetic, potentially toxic fragrance oils or paraffin will be found in our wax or scented products. It is important to us that we use natural products as both of us suffer with health issues, we therefore want our customers to have a safe and beneficial experience.
              <br><br>
              Our wax products are natural, renewable, and biodegradable. As soy wax has a lower melting point our candles will burn longer and cleaner.  The fragrance holding quality results in our scented products giving a lasting even scent throw. Our candles are made in small batches to ensure they are of high quality.
              <br><br>
              At Dart Valley Candles we source all natural, renewable biodegradable wax and essential oils which are cruelty free.  We hope our essential oil blends will bring tranquil times to your home, be it from our spicy blends, florals or succulent citrus scents.  Each of our candles will list the essential oils included.
